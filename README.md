### Hi there 👋
I'm Min-Chih :smile:
I'm from Taiwan and before starting my coding journey, I was dedicated to join the business world. However, I met a bootcamper from [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/), and that's how I got involved in the tech world. Here is a brief introduction of me:
- I am a Graduate Bootcamper from SoC :computer: 
- I like to play water sports (e.g. scuba diving, surfing, swimming) 🏊‍♀️
- I play tennis since I was in primary school, and I was also a team member of university tennis team 🎾

I have completed some projects with amazing teammates. Here are the links to the repos:
